# Introduction
The aim of this repo is to Document and Showcase my learning journey. As well as help those new to programing to find project ideas along with soruce code to guide them. Each of these projects will be built from scratch and I will try to document as much of the code as possible so that its easy to understand.

# Learning Objectives
Each project has its own challengers. When starting a new project try and do it yourself. You will learn more by starting from scratch instead of copying and pasting.
