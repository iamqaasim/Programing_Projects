# File Organiser

This project is designed to automate the organization of files on your system. It provides a simple solution to categorize and move files into different directories based on their extensions, making file management much easier.

## Features

- Automatically sorts files into folders based on file type (e.g., images, documents, videos).
- Allows configuration of directory paths and file types to be sorted.
- Provides an easy-to-use command line interface (CLI).
- Includes error handling and logging for smooth operations.

## Technologies Used

- Python (or specify the language you used)
- OS libraries for file management
- Command line interface (CLI) for interaction

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iamqaasim/Programing_Projects.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Programing_Projects/Intermediate/Automation/File_organiser
    ```
4. Run the script to organize files:
    ```bash
    python Folder_organiser.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the program is running, it will start sorting the files in the target directory based on predefined categories (images, documents, etc.). You can customize the script by editing the configuration options in the file.
